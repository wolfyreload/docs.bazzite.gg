## Customizing KDE Plasma

KDE Plasma is the default Bazzite desktop environment and is highly customizable. One of the various customization that can be done is installing custom styles, cursors, and icons to your system with custom themes made by the community.

The downloading of themes through Discover has been disabled due to issues regarding the slow loading of search results, and compatibility issues with themes written for old versions of KDE. This may change in the future; in the mean time, you can try to install themes through the KDE system settings, or install them manually.

!!! note

    Themes installed through the System Settings are installed into `~/.local/share/plasma`; to uninstall them, you may need to manually delete the folders associated with the installed themes manually.

## Universal instructions for most custom themes

Step-by-step instructions to install custom themes on KDE Plasma.

1. Download the theme manually from the [KDE Store](https://store.kde.org/browse/)
2. Extracting the contents to `~/.local/share/plasma/` (you may need to make this directory)
3. Open the system settings and select your theme, style, cursor etc. as it now should appear

### Theme Extraction Locations

The location where specific KDE Plasma components will be extracted on the desktop.

#### Global Themes

Global themes are placed in `~/.local/share/plasma/look-and-feel/` (_you may need to make this directory_).

#### Plasma Themes

"Plasma themes" are placed in `~/.local/share/plasma/desktoptheme/` (_you may need to make this directory_).

#### Plasma Window Decorations

"Window decoration themes" are placed in `~/.local/share/aurorae/themes/` (_you may need to make this directory_).

#### SDDM (Login Manager) Themes

Use Discover to install SDDM themes.  SDDM themes can also be layered **at your own risk** if they are available as RPM packages using [`rpm-ostree`](/Installing_and_Managing_Software/rpm-ostree.md).

#### Icon / Cursor Themes

"Icon/Cursor themes" are placed in `~/.local/share/icons`

#### Application Permissions to Use Themes

Some Flatpaks need filesystem permissions for applications that have issues with cursor themes.

**Example**: (`~/.local/share/icons/:ro` in "Filesystem" in each problematic application or globally in Flatseal).

#### Themes that require `kvantum`

Some themes require [`kvantum`](https://github.com/tsujan/Kvantum/blob/master/Kvantum/README.md) to be installed on the host system.

Install it with this **command**:

```
rpm-ostree install kvantum
```

## Wallpaper Engine Guide (_Only on KDE Images_)

!!! note   


    Not all wallpapers are compatible and may even cause issues since most are not intended for use on the Linux desktop. See their [note](https://github.com/catsout/wallpaper-engine-kde-plugin/blob/main/README.md#note) on supported wallpaper type.

**[Wallpaper Engine](https://www.wallpaperengine.io/en) is a live wallpaper application intended for Windows.**

Read this [guide](https://github.com/catsout/wallpaper-engine-kde-plugin/blob/main/README.md#usage) on how to set it up on KDE Plasma.

### Did Wallpaper Engine Break Your Desktop?

!!! warning

    This will remove any "applet" changes including widgets you have added or downloaded.

Open the terminal or enter a TTY session by entering <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F4</kbd> if you can't access the desktop.  Then enter the following command:

```command
mv ~/.config/plasma-org.kde.plasma.desktop-appletsrc ~/.config/plasma-org.kde.plasma.desktop-appletsrc.bak
```

Reboot your system after entering this command and the desktop session should no longer crash.

## Customizing Other Desktops and Sessions

### Manage GNOME Extensions (`-gnome` Images)

The "Extension Manager" applicaton alllows for installing new extensions to GNOME and managing currently pre-installed extensions.  Proceed with caution as extensions can make your system unstable and if your desktop crashes then GNOME will disable all of the extensions on the next boot.

### Steam Gaming Mode Tweaks (`-deck` Images)
!!! warning
    Decky Loader will sometimes have issues with new Steam and Gamescope updates, and may need to be uninstalled temporarily.

Install [Decky Loader](https://decky.xyz/) then install [CSS Loader](https://docs.deckthemes.com/) to customize how Steam Gaming Mode looks. Be aware that third-party plugins may cause issues. Read Bazzite's [Steam Gaming Mode documentation](../Handheld_and_HTPC_edition/quirks.md) to resolve common issues if you run into them after using Decky Loader.
