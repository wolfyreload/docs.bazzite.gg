## Unsupported Handhelds

!!! note
    
    Certain handhelds have been confirmed to boot Bazzite, but are plagued by missing driver support for Linux including missing audio drivers.

Unsupported handhelds _could work_ with Bazzite, but there may be major issues encountered that are undocumented. If your handheld hardware is not listed, then you can still give Bazzite a try with our Bazzite-Deck image.

Your mileage may vary with untested hardware. Bazzite does **not** have the required setup for unsupported handheld, so setup will be manually done by the end-user for different functionality if it even works properly on the unsupported device.

## HHD Setup (If Not Enabled By Default on Device)

**Commands for functional HHD**:

```command
systemctl start hhd@yourusername
```

```command
systemctl enable hhd@yourusername
```

!!! important
    Replace `yourusername` with your Bazzite username.
